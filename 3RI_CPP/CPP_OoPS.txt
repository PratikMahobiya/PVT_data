OOPS concepts:-

1. Class:-
	1. it is a blueprint.
	2. class  is a collection of simmilar objects.
	
	synatx:-
		access modifier class class_name
		{
			fields;
			constructor;
			methods;
			  :
			  :
		}

2. Object:-
	-> instance of class.
	-> object is a real world entity.
	-> Object occupies space.
	-> object consists of/property:-
		a. Indentity:-
		b. state/attribute:-
		c. behaviour:-

	syntax:
		class_name  class_obj; / class_name  class_obj=new;

3. Inheritance:
	-> Base class-> Derivd Class
	-> Super class-> Sub class
	-> Parent class-> Child class
	Type of Inhertiance:-
		a. Single Inhertiance.
		b. Multi-level Inheritance.
		c. Multiple Inheritance.
		d. Hierarical Inheritance.
		e. Hybrid Inheritance.
	Adv:-
		1. Reusability.
		2. Implement the polymorphism by using Inheritance.
	Disadv:-
		1. Tightlg coupled class create problems(changes in parent affect the childs).

4. Polymorphism:-
	Type of polymorphism:-
		a.  Compiletime polymorphism:-
					Different situation-> behaves differently.
					Static Polymorphism.
					Early Binding.
		b.  Runtime Polymorphism:-
					Dynamic polymorphism.
					Late polymorphism.
		Eg:- Method Overloading and Method Riding.

5. Abstraction:-
	-> Abstraction is nothing but hiding the implementation details highlighting the set
	of services.
	-> Security.

6. Encapsulation:-
	-> Wrapping of data.
