			if(me==you)
			printf("I love U");
			else
			printf("I hate U");
			}
			Answer:
			I hate U
			Explanation:
			For floating point numbers (float, double, long double) the values cannot be
			predicted exactly. Depending on the number of bytes, the precession with of the value
			represented varies. Float takes 4 bytes and long double takes 10 bytes. So float stores 0.9 with
			less precision than long double.
			Rule of Thumb:
			Never compare or at-least be cautious when using floating point numbers with
			relational operators (== , >, <, <=, >=,!= ) .
			4. main()
			{
			static int var = 5;
			printf("%d ",var--);
			if(var)
			main();
			}
			Answer:
			5 4 3 2 1
			Explanation:
			When static storage class is given, it is initialized once. The change in the
			value of a static variable is retained even between the function calls. Main is also treated like
			any other ordinary function, which can be called recursively.
			5. main()
			{
			int c[ ]={2.8,3.4,4,6.7,5};
			int j,*p=c,*q=c;
			for(j=0;j<5;j++) {
			printf(" %d ",*c);
			++q; }
			for(j=0;j<5;j++){
			printf(" %d ",*p);
			++p; }
			}
			Answer:
			2 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 6 5
