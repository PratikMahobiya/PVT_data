			<p> Sanskrit is an ancient language of India which continues its age
				old form together with its several descendent languages in
				different parts of India. Because of its continuity of language
				form, it has been preserver of Indiaâ€™s millennia long tradition
				which is documented in manuscripts, books, and in some part
				in oral traditions. In the course of time, Sanskrit has lost much
				of its heritage and its scope and usage may have become
				restricted. Even then, a large number of texts on different
				subjects and from different ages are still preserved. What we
				have today should be saved from being lost. Easy means of
				preservation and accessing may play important role in
				preserving a significant part of the cultural heritage of India as
				well as providing an insight into cultural past of the country.
